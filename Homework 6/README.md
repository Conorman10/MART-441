# MART-441 Homework 5

When I plugged the homework requirements into ChatGBT, it created a website all on one page. It used JavaScript, CSS, and index.html properties, all one after another. It even found a way to generate completely random images every time by using the URL:  "https://picsum.photos/100/100?random=1 and changing the number at the end before copying and pasting it 12 times.

It also used a bunch of coding things that we haven’t gone over yet. Overall, I don’t know what ChatGBT did, but it made a website that resulted in exactly what we were supposed to make for this assignment. Hopefully we can go over some of the things that ChatGBT came up with in future assignments, because it did use a lot less code than I did to create my picture game.
