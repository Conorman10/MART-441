# Homework 2

What I created on my own was very similar to what was created by ChatGBT when I inputted this asssignment into it. The only difference between my responses and ChatGBT's responses were taht I added blank spaces to better sperated each of the 4 prompts that we were both required to make. Personally, I did have trouble making the prompt with an answer and chatGBT actually helped me figure out what I was doing wrong and helped me fix my website. So in a way, me and ChatGBT helped each other. I will say, If I had just copied and pasted what ChatGBT came up with for this specific assignment I wouldn't be too upset about it since JavaScript at this level of simplicyt is hard to do in your own unique way. On future, more complex assignments though, I would definetly see it as stealing if I used chatGBT' work to create my ow nwebsite, since there will be a lot more areas in which I can put my own personal touches on things.
