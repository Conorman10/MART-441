        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                Hello everyone! My name is Conor Manley and I am a senior filmmaking student at the University of Montana <br/>
                Throughout my time in Montana I have enjoyed skiing, lifting, and floating the river. <br/> I have learned to love this state and can't wait to keep coming back here throughout my life.

        <h2>GAMES</h2>
        <p>
            I have played more than my fair share of video games throughout my time here on planet Earth. So much so that I am concerned that I need to be spending more time living real life. However, it's cold outside, so for now gaming is real life to me. <br/>
            Anyways, I still remember how I felt when I first played through Portal 2. The game was amazing and was an unexpected but welcome blend between story and puzzle gameplay <br/>
            I still think back to how I felt when I beat that game after tirelessly griding through puzzles. I bet it felt similar to how people feel when they beat a Dark Souls game nowadays. Probably not, but a kid can dream.
