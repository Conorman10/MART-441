    <br>
        Jimmy has been wandering around in the forest for a while now, not knowng where he came from, and not knowing where he is going.
        <br>
        In the distance, Jimmy sees a deer standing on it's hind legs, like a person, leaning against a tree.
        <br>
        Jimmy gets closer to the deer. The deer jolts awake and looks right at Jimmy. Startled, the deer yells "Who are you!"
        <br>
        "My name is Jimmy" says Jimmy. the deer broods as he looks at Jimmy up and down.
        <br>
        "Oh yeah Jimmy, then what's your favorite snack?" asks the deer.
        <br>
        Jimmy mulls the answer over. His reply here could be the difference between life and death.
        <br>
        Is it waffles, or is it ice cream?
