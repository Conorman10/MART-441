# MART-441 Homework 3

This assignment took me a while to understand. Java is a difficult language for me to understand, and it took a while to understand how everything works in Javascript. Thankfully you showed us a homework example thatt helped me understand everything that I needed to understand for this assignment.

I enjoyed creating a story for this assignment, as it allowed me to have fun while coding. It's not that I dislike coding, but it can feel very tedious and strenuous at times. This assignment reminded me of when I took Creative Coding, since we were allowed to exercise our Creativity in a medium that I had never explored before.

When I plugged this assignment into ChatGPT, most of the functions were the same in both my code and ChatGPT's code. the main difference between our code was that ChatGPT did everything on one index.html page, whereas I linked a separate "main.js" page. ChatGBT also made it so that there were only four screens, and that you could die one each of the first three screens. So, rather than pose 6 different questions with 12 different endings, ChatGBT only had one ending screen. ChatGBT also didn't include an option to restart, which I felt was necessary for the flow of my game. I might try to make a game like ChatGBT did in a future assignment.
